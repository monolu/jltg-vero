<h1 style="margin-top:0;">QUICKSTART GUIDE</h1>

<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>Welcome to <i>Hide And Seek!</i> Let's cut to the chase: this is a long
rulebook. But we promise that ultimately, this game is pretty simple.
The basic gameplay can be summed up in five steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>One player uses <b>public transit</b> to get to a <b>hiding spot.</b></li>
  <li>The other players work together to find them by <b>asking questions</b>
  about their location, chosen from our <b>six question categories.</b></li>
  <li>Each time the hider answers a question, they draw cards from the
  <b>hider deck.</b> These cards give them advantages in the game.</li>
  <li>Once the hider is found by the seekers, another player hides.</li>
  <li>At the end, <b>whoever hid the longest wins.</b></li>
</ol>

<p>While the overall structure is simple, there's a bit more you'll need to
know before playing. Starting with:</p>

<h2>CHOOSING GAME SIZE</h2>
<p>Hide and Seek is configured to be played at three different scales:
small, medium, or large. These sizes have slightly different rules
designed to work best with your map’s size and complexity. Before
you do any further set up, you’ll need to determine whether you
want to play a small, medium, or large game of Hide and Seek.</p>

<h2 style="background:rgb(239, 181, 19); margin-top:10px;">SMALL</h2>
<p style="display:inline; margin-left: 21px;">Spans a single town, small city, or portion of a large city; lasts 4–8 hours</p>
<p style="margin-left: 76px; margin-top:5px;"><i>Examples: Lower Manhattan, Winston-Salem, NC</i></p>

<h2 style="background:rgb(208, 102, 41); margin-top:10px;">MEDIUM</h2>
<p style="display:inline; margin-left: 10px;">Spans a major city, metro area; lasts about 1 day</p>
<p style="margin-left: 76px; margin-top:5px;"><i>Examples: Hong Kong, New York City, Greater London, UK</i></p>

<h2 style="background:rgb(208, 41, 41); margin-top:10px;">LARGE</h2>
<p style="display: inline; margin-left: 23px;">Spans a large region, an entire country, or several
small countries; lasts 2 to 4 days</p>
<p style="margin-left: 76px; margin-top:5px;"><i>Examples: Switzerland, Japan, New England, US</i></p>

<p>The other major decision that will need to be made concerning game
length is whether you want to add additional rounds. In the simplest
configuration of the game, each player/team hides a single time—
once everyone has had a chance to hide, the longest hiding time wins.
We consider hiding once per player to be the default version of
the game, and it's what we recommend unless you are willing to
commit significantly more time to playing. If you do choose to add
additional rounds, hiding time is not counted cumulatively—it is only
a player’s best round that counts.</p>

<h2>CREATING TEAMS</h2>
<p>Generally, we do not recommend playing with more than four
players. If you do want to play with more than four players, we would
suggest grouping some players into teams. These teams (of two or
more) could effectively act as a single player, all hiding together when
it is their turn to hide. There may be some unforeseen awkwardness
with how to answer certain questions that are intended for a single
player, which will need to be resolved on a case-by-case basis. Teams
are also recommended when playing with younger players, or in any
context where a hider would feel unsafe or uncomfortable being
alone for an extended period of time.</p>

<h2>SETTING YOUR MAP</h2>
<p>After you have chosen a game size and assembled your players,
you'll need to set up your game map. This involves choosing a transit
system and establishing map borders.</p>

<h2>ROUND START</h2>
<p>At the start of each round, one player/team will become the hider,
while the remaining players will band together to play as that round’s
seekers. The order in which each player hides should be determined,
at random, before the game begins.</p>

<p>While all players are still at the starting location—which can be
anywhere within the game map—there are a few items to be
distributed. The hider receives the hider deck, and the seekers
take the investigation book. We also recommend each side take a
rulebook to reference in case there is need for clarification or if any
rules discrepancies arise. Optionally, the seekers might also choose
to print out a map of their game area so that they can mark it as they
play, and carry writing implements to take notes. Both sides should
also keep at least two dice on them at all times, as these are used for
various different things throughout the game.</p>

<p>Each round begins with a hiding period. During this time, the hider
can use their legs and public transit to travel to any transit station
within the map’s boundaries. Once the hiding period has concluded,
the hider must stay within their hiding zone for the rest of the round.
The length of the hiding period is determined by game size:</p>

<h2 style="background:rgb(239, 181, 19); margin-top:10px;">SMALL</h2><p style="display: inline; margin-left: 26px;"> 30 minutes</p><br>
<h2 style="background:rgb(208, 102, 41); margin-top:10px;">MEDIUM</h2><p style="display: inline; margin-left: 15px;"> 1 hour</p><br>
<h2 style="background:rgb(208, 41, 41); margin-top:10px;">LARGE</h2><p style="display: inline; margin-left: 28px;"> 2 hours</p>

<p>Lastly, all seekers should make sure to turn on some form of tracker
during this period to ensure that the hider can follow their movement
throughout the round. You can use real GPS trackers if you happen to
have them, but the easiest option for most people is to download one of
the many free smartphone apps that allow other phones to track your
phone’s location. (We use Apple’s “Find My” app, but Google Maps also
allows for live location sharing if any players are using Android phones.)</p>

<h2>HIDING ZONES</h2>
<p>At the end of the hiding period, the hider must be at a transit station/
stop that is included in the game’s map—this now acts as the center
of their hiding zone. The hiding zone extends a certain distance in
all directions from the transit station, forming a circle within which
the hider may move freely until the end game begins. For small and
medium games, the hiding zone extends a 1/4 mile from the transit
station; for large games, the hiding zone extends a 1/2 mile from the
transit station.</p>

<h2>ASKING QUESTIONS</h2>
<p>In order to gather information about the hider’s location, the seekers
will have to ask questions from the investigation book. These
questions can be asked at any time, as long as the previous question
has been answered, and must be answered truthfully by the hider
within 5 minutes, with the exception of photo questions, which must be
answered within 10 minutes in small and medium games, and 20
minutes in large games. We ask hiders to make a good faith effort to
answer all questions in the allotted time. However, if questions are
not answered in the allowed time window, the hider’s time is paused
until the question is answered, and the hider will receive no card in
exchange for answering.</p>

<p>After a question has been answered, the hider may draw any cards
from the hider deck, indicated in the investigation book, depending
on the category of question asked.</p>

<p>Once a question has been asked, it cannot be asked again unless the
seekers choose to pay its cost twice. So, for example, a question
that would typically allow a hider to draw 3 cards and keep 1 would
now allow a hider to draw 3, keep 1, then draw 3, and keep 1 again.
(Importantly: hiders cannot draw 6 and keep 2—they must draw 3 and
pull 1 two separate times, in this example.) Should seekers want to ask
a question a third time, its cost would be triple; a fourth time, the cost
quadrupled, and so on.</p>

<p>As you gather information about the hider’s location, you can use the
internet for research to develop your theories. The only prohibited
source of information is Google Street View; everything else is fair
game.</p>

<h2>THE HIDER DECK</h2>
<p>The hider deck contains three types of cards that the hider can use
to their advantage: time bonus cards, powerup cards, and curse
cards. Cards are drawn after a question is answered, and kept in the
hider’s hand until they are played or discarded into the discard pile.
The hider can keep 6 cards in their hand at a time (unless their
hand size has been expanded through a powerup.) If, at any point,
the hider has exceeded their hand limit, they must immediately play
or discard cards until they only have 6 cards remaining.</p>

<h2>THE END GAME</h2>
<p>Once the seekers have entered the hider’s hiding zone—and are
no longer on a mode of transit—the end game will begin. At this
point, the hider may no longer move freely; they must stay put in
a publicly accessible hiding spot until they are found.</p>

<p>During the end game, some questions may be impossible to answer
due to restrictions on the hider’s movement. For example, a photo
question that would require the hider to take a photo from the train
station, when they are not at the train station, would not be possible.
In these cases, “I cannot answer the question” is considered a valid
answer, and the hider would still pull a card. All questions other than
photo questions that must be taken from a particular location should
be possible to answer during the end game.</p>

<h2>ROTATING ROUNDS</h2>
<p>The hider is considered found once the seekers are within 5 feet of
them and have spotted them. If the seekers are near the hider but
haven’t yet identified them, then the hider hasn’t been caught.
At this point, the hider’s clock is stopped, and all time bonus cards still
in the hider’s hand are added to their time total.</p>

<p>After the hider is caught, the new hider is permitted up to 10 minutes
for any final planning before their hiding period begins. During this
time, the new seekers should reshuffle all cards back into the deck
and hand it off to the new hider, turn on their trackers, exchange the
investigation book, and ensure that the new hider’s tracker is turned
off. They will begin the next round from the last hider’s hiding spot.</p>

<p>After each player has completed the predetermined number of hiding
rounds, the player with the longest single hiding run is declared
the winner.</p>

<!-- SECTION 2 -->
<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">SECTION 2</h4>
<h1 style="margin-top:0;">SETTING UP YOUR MAP</h1>
<p>Our goal, when designing Hide and Seek, was to make a game that can
be played almost anywhere in the world. In order to accomplish this,
we established a few simple steps that should generate a viable game
map wherever you choose to play. Here’s how to set the parameters
of your game.</p>

<h2>CHOOSING A TRANSIT SYSTEM</h2>
<p>Your local transit system is the backbone of Hide and Seek. While this
game can be played with cars or on foot, as we will detail later, we
strongly recommend using public transit for this game. Hide and
Seek can be played on trains, trams, metros, light rails, buses, ferries,
or any other form of public transit, but you’ll need to define which
systems are in play before starting your game. Given that each hiding
zone will be centered around a transit station, it’s crucial that your
game includes a sufficient number of stations to keep it engaging and
open-ended—this should determine how many different systems
you’ll want to include. (If, for example, you have a metro system
that only has a few dozen stops, you should consider layering a bus
system on top of it to increase complexity.)</p>

<p>Here’s our best estimate for ideal map size and transit complexity in
different scale games:</p>

<h2 style="background:rgb(239, 181, 19); margin-top:10px;">SMALL</h2><p style="display: inline; margin-left: 26px;"> 30-100 stations; 10 - 100 sq. miles</p><br>
<h2 style="background:rgb(208, 102, 41); margin-top:10px;">MEDIUM</h2><p style="display: inline; margin-left: 15px;"> 100 - 500 stations; 100 - 1,000 sq. miles</p><br>
<h2 style="background:rgb(208, 41, 41); margin-top:10px;">LARGE</h2><p style="display: inline; margin-left: 28px;"> 500+ stations; 1,000+ sq. miles</p>

<p>(As a point of comparison, our game in Switzerland comprised of
1,800 stations, and our game in Japan was slightly over 8,500, both of
which would be considered “Large.”)</p>

<h2>SETTING MAP BORDERS</h2>
<p>After you’ve determined the edges of your transit system, you
need to establish a set of definitive borders for your game’s map.
As we’ve mentioned, the scale of your map is entirely up to you—
whether it spans your county or your continent—but it is crucial
that all players are using the exact same set of borders.</p>

<p>In some cases, these borders can be naturally emergent and possibly
standardized: a game that spans a single country, for example, might
simply be contained to the borders of that country. For smaller scale
games—like those that take place in a single city or metro area—
natural borders might be more ill-defined. (How big is Atlanta? No one
knows!) In these cases, we would recommend setting your own hard
borders using a tool like Google My Maps. Generally, it’s best to draw
the totality of the transit system.</p>

<p>It’s also extremely important to ensure all players feel safe going
to all areas of the map. Players should discuss safety beforehand,
and if there are any areas where players would not feel comfortable
going, they should be excluded from the map.</p>

<h2>CONSIDERING REST PERIODS</h2>
<p>If your game is large enough to potentially span multiple days, you will
also need to set rest periods for each day. For the sake of fairness, we
recommend doing this ahead of time. These can be as long as you’d
like, so long as all players reset to their exact positions when the
game resumes. We’d recommend a minimum of 10 hours, in order for
all players to get sufficient rest.</p>

<h2>ENDING YOUR GAME</h2>
<p>Generally, Hide and Seek ends once the predetermined number of
rounds is complete. If, however, you’re playing with a hard out (i.e. you
have a flight home or, you know, need to go to school/work),
we would also recommend setting an end-of-game timer. In that case,
the game would end whenever you reach the predetermined number
of rounds or the timer runs out, whichever comes first.</p>

<!-- SECTION 3 -->
<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">SECTION 3</h4>
<h1 style="margin-top:0;">SEEKING</h1>
<p>As the seeker, it is your job to move and gather information as
efficiently as possible. At your disposal are 80 questions, which
you can ask the hider at any time. The hider must answer all of your
questions truthfully, but in exchange for answers, they’ll be rewarded
with cards from their hider deck. Choosing the right questions at the
right time is the key to a quick round—ask too many, and you’ll be
bogged down with curses or blown out with hours of time bonuses.</p>

<p>To make sorting through these questions easier, we’ve divided them
into six simple categories. All of the questions in the same category
cost the same number of cards, and share the same sentence
structure—it’s simply a matter of choosing a noun or value. Some
categories are more useful during different stages of your search,
so be sure to keep an open mind and change up your strategy as you
close in on the hider.</p>

<p>You cannot ask multiple questions at once; if you are waiting on an
answer from a previous question, you cannot ask your next question
until the first has been answered.</p>

<p>You can use the internet for research, but you cannot use Google
Street View. We have found Street View to be far too powerful when
it comes to matching photos, and it makes the game generally less
fun. This is our only strict rule about research, though you can opt
to implement other rules if your group deems them necessary, such
as an additional ban on searching for any images of train stations.</p>

<p>As you collect information, you should record it in your investigation
book and on a printout of your game map. There are many types
of information you can collect in a given round—photos, direction
clues, and context clues—and you’ll want to stay on top of everything if
you want any chance at finding your hider.</p>

<h2>A NOTE ABOUT MAPPING APPS (AND THEIR ERRORS)</h2>
<p>Effectively playing this game is going to require using a maps app on
your smartphone or other device. We’ll just say right now: we highly
recommend that you use Google Maps for playing this game. We
designed the game, and our question categories, with Google
Maps in mind, so you’ll likely get the best gameplay when using it;
it’s also the only major mapping app where it is easy to measure
distances, which will often be necessary for questions. In order to
measure a distance, hold down anywhere on Google Maps that is not
a formally listed location. A pin will pop up and if you scroll down you
can select “measure distance,” then drag to measure from that point.</p>

<p>We will mention that Apple Maps has superior rail visualization and
occasionally more accurate timetables, so it is useful for certain
game aspects. When we play, we use Apple Maps to see rail options,
but Google Maps for everything else.</p>

<p>You’ll notice that many of our questions reference various categories
of businesses or locations: parks, zoos, hospitals, museums, etc. We
chose these carefully—almost all of them have their own special
category categorization in Google Maps and Apple Maps, with their
own special icon to help you easily see them. Amusement parks have
a Ferris wheel icon, libraries have a book, and so on. You should be
able to see all the places that fall under a given category by simply
searching that category in your app and looking for those icons.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, you’ll notice there are sometimes categorization
errors. A random parking lot will be erroneously listed as an
amusement park, for example. Determining what is an error and what
is not is often subjective, but given the need for objective rules, here
is our criteria:</p>

<h3>IF YOU ARE USING GOOGLE MAPS:</h3>
<p>Anywhere with 5 or more Google Reviews is assumed to be legitimate,
unless all players can agree otherwise. Anywhere with fewer than 5
Google Reviews is assumed to be illegitimate, unless all players can
agree otherwise.</p>

<h3>IF YOU ARE USING APPLE MAPS, OR ANOTHER MAPPING APP:</h3>
<p>Everywhere is assumed to be legitimate, unless all players can agree
otherwise.</p>

<p>Whatever app you choose, it’s very important that the hider and
seekers are using the same maps app when searching in these
categories. If the seekers and hiders search on different apps, they
will often get different results, leading to confusion.</p>

<p>In general, it is the responsibility of the seekers to clarify any
ambiguity in what they are asking—for example, by sending a
screenshot of everything they understand to qualify as an amusement
park when asking if the hider is near one.</p>

<h2>MATCHING QUESTIONS</h2>
<p>Matching questions follow the format, “Is your nearest ___ the same
as my nearest ___?” Valid answers are yes or no. Hiders have 5
minutes to answer. These questions can be useful at any point in
the game, though they often require the seekers to move in order to
optimize their efficacy. It is important to note that if locations are
not within a map’s boundaries, players must operate as if they do
not exist. For example, if the seekers asked if they shared the same
nearest commercial airport as the hider, but the only commercial
airports were outside the map’s boundaries, it would return a
null answer (null answers count as answered questions, and hiders do
get to draw cards).</p>

<p>After a matching question has been answered, the hider may draw 3
cards and keep 1.</p>

<p>These are the matching questions available to the seekers:</p>

<h3>TRANSIT</h3>

<h4>Commercial Airport</h4>
<p>If there is any ambiguity, an airport is considered commercial if you
can view flights to/from it via Google Flights (flights.google.com)</p>
<h4>Transit Line</h4>
<p><i>Important:</i> In order to ask this question, seekers must be on a mode of transit and it must be moving.</p>
<p>The answer is yes if the transit line the seekers are currently riding will
    stop at the hider’s station. For clarity, best practice is for seekers to
    screenshot all the stations their transit will stop at and send it to
    the hider.</p>
    <p>If the seekers are on a limited-stop/express train that passes through
    the hider’s station but does not stop at it, the hider should say
    “no.” A “yes” answer is only given when the seekers’ train would stop
    at the hider’s station.</p>
  <h4>Station Name's Length</h4>
    <p>Number of characters (hyphens and spaces count) in the station name,
    as defined by your mapping app. If the app includes the word “station,”
    that counts.</p>
  <h4>Street or Path</h4>
    <p>A street or path is considered to have ended when it acquires a
    different name. This includes changing from, say, “Jet Lag St. East” to
    “Jet Lag St. West.”</p>
    <p>If the street or path is unnamed, it is considered to start or end
    wherever it has an intersection.</p>

    <h3>ADMINISTRATIVE DIVISIONS</h3>
  <h4>1st Administrative Division</h4>
    <p>This is the biggest formal category of division. For the US, it would be
    states. In Switzerland, cantons. In Japan, prefectures.</p>
  <h4>2nd Administrative Division</h4>
    <p>This is the next detailed level of division. In the US, this is counties. In
    Switzerland, districts. In Japan, subprefectures.</p>
  <h4>3rd Administrative Division</h4>
    <p>One more level down. In the US, Switzerland, and Japan, this would
    be municipality. Municipality borders can be occasionally difficult to
    define, so it’s up to the seekers to clarify any ambiguity.</p>
  <h4>4th Administrative Division</h4>
    <p>Some places have no fourth administrative division, but many larger
    cities do. For example, New York City has boroughs, Zurich has
    districts, Tokyo has special wards.</p>
  <h3>NATURAL</h3>
    <h4>Mountain</h4>
    <p>Anything correctly classified as a mountain by your mapping app.</p>
  <h4>Landmass</h4>
    <p>A single piece of land that’s one piece, not broken up by water
    1 mile or more in width at any crossing. If the hider is on a landmass
    that is entirely surrounded by water and that’s not the one the
    seekers are on, it counts as different. We urge players to be
    reasonable about this. There can be an interesting geography
    discussion about what is an island and what isn’t.</p>
  <h4>Park</h4>
    <p>Anything correctly classified as a park by your mapping app.
    Measure distance from the map icon.</p>
  <h3>PLACES OF INTEREST</h3>
    <h4>Amusement Park</h4>
    <p>Anything correctly categorized as an amusement park by your
    mapping app. Measure distance from the map icon.</p>
  <h4>Zoo</h4>
    <p>Anything correctly categorized as a zoo by your mapping app.
    Measure distance from the map icon.</p>
  <h4>Aquarium</h4>
    <p>Anything correctly categorized as an aquarium by your mapping app.
    Measure distance from the map icon.</p>
  <h4>Golf Course</h4>
    <p>An outdoor golf course. Miniature golf does not count. Driving ranges
    do not count. Measure distance from the map icon.
    (We urge seekers to clarify their understanding of what counts when
    sending this question.)</p>
  <h4>Museum</h4>
    <p>Anything correctly categorized as a museum by your mapping app.
    Measure distance from the map icon.</p>
  <h4>Movie Theater</h4>
    <p>Anything correctly categorized as a movie theater by your mapping
    app. Measure distance from the map icon.</p>
  <h3>PUBLIC UTILITIES</h3>
    <h4>Hospital</h4>
    <p>Anything correctly categorized as a hospital by your mapping app.
    Measure distance from the map icon.</p>
  <h4>Library</h4>
    <p>Anything correctly categorized as a library by your mapping app.
    Measure distance from the map icon.</p>
  <h4>Foreign Consulate</h4>
    <p>Anything correctly categorized as a foreign consulate by your mapping
    app. Exclude honorary consulates. Measure distance from the map icon.</p>

<h2>MEASURING QUESTIONS</h2>
<p>Measuring questions follow the format, “Compared to me, are you
closer to or farther from ___?” Valid answers are “closer” or “farther.”
Hiders have five minutes to answer. These questions are also
universally useful, and good for slicing the map in unique and
clever ways. It is important to note that if locations are not within
a map’s boundaries, players must operate as if they do not exist.
For example, if the seekers asked if they were closer to or farther from
an international border than the hider, but there were no international
borders in the map’s boundaries, it would return a null answer (null
answers count as answered questions, and hiders get to draw cards).</p>

<p>After a measuring question has been answered, the hider may draw 3
cards and keep 1.</p>

<p>These are the measuring questions available to the seekers:</p>

  <h3>TRANSIT-RELATED</h3>
    <h4>Commercial Airport</h4>
    <p>If there is any ambiguity, an airport is considered commercial if you
    can view flights to/from it via Google Flights (flights.google.com)</p>
  <h4>High-Speed Train Line</h4>
    <p>Different countries sometimes have different definitions of high-
    speed rail, so it is worth using whatever definition is officially
    applicable. Otherwise, we recommend following the EU definition:
    a minimum speed of 250 km/h (158 mph) on lines specially built for
    high speed and of about 200 km/h (124 mph) on existing lines which
    have been specially upgraded.</p>
  <h4>Rail Station</h4>
    <p>Includes light and heavy rail, metros/subways. Count them all.</p>
  <h3>BORDERS</h3>
    <h4>International Border</h4>
    <p>Enclaves count!</p>
  <h4>1st Administrative Division Border</h4>
    <p>This is a border between the biggest formal category of division. For
    the US, it would be states. In Switzerland, cantons. In Japan,
    prefectures.</p>
  <h4>2nd Administrative Division Border</h4>
    <p>This is a border between the next level of division. In the US, this is
    counties. In Switzerland, districts. In Japan, subprefectures.</p>
  <h4>3rd Administrative Division Border</h4>
    <p>One more level down. In the US, Switzerland, Japan, this refers to
    municipalities. Municipality borders can be occasionally tricky.</p>
  <h3>ELEVATION</h3>
    <p>This refers to a player’s altitude.</p>
    <p>You can find this using your phone’s compass. Fair warning: it
    sometimes might be inaccurate. Don’t rely on it to be 100% exact.</p>
  <h3>NATURAL</h3>
    <h4>Body of Water</h4>
    <p>Any named body of water on your maps app, excluding pools.</p>
  <h4>Coastline</h4>
    <p>Okay, so: defining where a coastline begins is a famously difficult
    geographical question. Here is the definition we have developed—
    we’re not saying it’s perfect, but at least it’s objective:
    For our purposes, a coastline is defined as any place where land
    meets either the ocean, a great lake, or a body of water that flows
    directly into the ocean or great lake via a waterway that is never less
    than 1 mile across.</p>
  <h4>Mountain</h4>
    <p>Anything correctly classified as a mountain by your mapping app.
    Measure distance from the map icon.</p>
  <h4>Park</h4>
    <p>Anything correctly classified as a park by your mapping app. Measure
    distance from the map icon. As noted in the park matching question,
    this can lead to strangeness. If you are in a large park, a mile from the
    icon, you might have to say you are a mile away from any park, despite
    literally being in a park. Nonetheless, we believe sticking to the icon
    distance is the best method.</p>
  <h3>PLACES OF INTEREST</h3>
    <h4>Amusement Park</h4>
    <p>Anything correctly categorized as an amusement park by your
    mapping app. Measure distance from the map icon.</p>
  <h4>Zoo</h4>
    <p>Anything correctly categorized as a zoo by your mapping app.
    Measure distance from the map icon.</p>
  <h4>Aquarium</h4>
    <p>Anything correctly categorized as an aquarium by your mapping app.
    Measure distance from the map icon.</p>
  <h4>Golf Course</h4>
    <p>An outdoor golf course. Miniature golf does not count, driving ranges
    do not count. Measure distance from the map icon.</p>
  <h4>Museum</h4>
    <p>Anything correctly categorized as a museum by your mapping app.
    Measure distance from the map icon.</p>
  <h4>Movie Theater</h4>
    <p>Anything correctly categorized as a movie theater by your mapping
    app. Measure distance from the map icon.</p>
  <h3>PUBLIC UTILITIES</h3>
    <h4>Hospital</h4>
    <p>Anything correctly categorized as a hospital by your mapping app.
    Measure distance from the map icon.</p>
  <h4>Library</h4>
    <p>Anything correctly categorized as a library by your mapping app.
    Measure distance from the map icon.</p>
  <h4>Foreign Consulate</h4>
    <p>Anything correctly categorized as a foreign consulate by your mapping
    app. Exclude honorary consulates. Measure distance from the map icon.</p>

<h2>RADAR QUESTIONS</h2>
<p>Radar questions follow the format, “Are you within ___ of me?” Valid
answers are yes or no. Hiders have five minutes to answer. These
questions are a good way of verifying whether you are in the right
general area or crossing off a particularly dense part of the map. (It
is easiest to measure these distances using a long press or right click
in Google Maps and using the “measure” tool.) It’s important to note
that it’s talking about your location, not your hiding zone. If the
seekers measure a pass part of your hiding zone, but not your location
proper, it would be a miss.</p>

<p>After a radar question has been answered, the hider may draw 2
cards and keep 1.</p>

<p>These are the radar questions available to the seekers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>1/4 Mile</li>
  <li>1/2 Mile</li>
  <li>1 Mile</li>
  <li>3 Miles</li>
  <li>5 Miles</li>
  <li>10 Miles</li>
  <li>25 Miles</li>
  <li>50 Miles</li>
  <li>100 Miles</li>
  <li>Choose (for this you may use any distance you wish)</li>
</ul>

<h2>THERMOMETER QUESTIONS</h2>
<p>Thermometer questions follow the format, “After traveling ___, am I
hotter or colder?” Valid answers are hotter or colder. Hiders have
five minutes to answer. When starting a thermometer question, you
should inform the hider that you are starting a thermometer and send
them your current location (we recommend sending a pin through
Google or Apple Maps). Then, after traveling a sufficient distance—
measured as the crow flies—send them your new location. If the
new location is closer to the hider’s current location, then you are
hotter; otherwise, you are colder. These questions are a good way
of determining whether you’re moving in the right direction.</p>

<p>After a thermometer question has been answered, the hider may
draw 2 cards and keep 1.</p>

<h2>PHOTO QUESTIONS</h2>
<p>Photo questions follow the format, “Send me a photo of ___.” Valid
answers are a photo that meets the full specifications of the
question, or “I cannot answer the question,” in situations where the
subject of the photograph doesn’t exist in the hiding zone. Hiders
have ten minutes to answer in small and medium games, and 20
minutes in large games. All photos must be sent in your
phone’s normal aspect ratio. Photos are a useful way of getting
a general sense of where the hider is, or for verifying that you’ve
arrived at the right location, but you cannot use Google Street View
to assess photos or verify stations from afar.</p>

<p>These are the photo questions available to the seekers in small-sized
games:</p>
  <h4>Any Building Visible from Transit Station</h4>
     <p>Must stand directly outside a station entrance. If there are multiple
     entrances, you may choose. Must include roof and both sides, with
     the top of the building in the top 1/3 of the frame.</p>
  <h4>Widest Street</h4>
     <p>Must include both sides of the street; does not have to include the
     background.</p>
  <h4>Tree</h4>
     <p>Must include the entire tree.</p>
  <h4>Tallest Structure in Your Current Sightline</h4>
     <p>Must include top and both sides. The top must be in the top 1/3 of
     the frame. Note that if you can see a distant tall building miles away,
     but a nearer building appears taller from your viewpoint, you use
     the nearer one.</p>
  <h4>You</h4>
     <p>Selfie mode. Phone perpendicular to ground, arm fully extended,
     using your phone’s default lens with no zoom.</p>
  <h4>The Sky</h4>

  <h4>Tallest Building Visible from Transit Station</h4>
     <p>This is the tallest building from your perspective, not the objectively
     tallest building overall. Must stand directly outside a station
     entrance. If multiple entrances, pick one. Must include roof and both
     sides, top of the building in the top 1/3 of the frame.</p>
  <h4>Trace Nearest Street/Path</h4>
     <p>Street/path must be visible on mapping app; trace intersection to
     intersection.</p><p>This can be a little tricky to do; we have a few methods. One is to screenshot this on your phone, then use the drawing tools on your phone's photo editing app to black out everything but the street.

     water is fully inside your zone, the big partial one is still “the largest.”</p>
  <h4>5 Buildings</h4>
     <p>Must include the bottom and up to four stories.</p>

<p>After a photo question has been answered, the hider may draw 1 card
and keep 1.</p>

<h2>TENTACLE QUESTIONS</h2>
<p>Tentacle questions follow the format, “Within ___ miles of me,
which ___ are you nearest to? (You must also be within ___ of me
to count.)” If the hider is within the reach of the tentacle question,
they must answer with the name of one of the listed options. If the
hider is not within range of any, they say “not within reach.” Hiders
have five minutes to answer. Tentacle questions are most useful near
the end of the game to quickly narrow down a region of density at an
extremely high cost. To help visualize, imagine each of these locations
becoming a “tentacle” reaching out from the seekers.</p>

<p>After a tentacle question has been answered, the hider may draw 4
cards and keep 2.</p>

<!-- HIDING SECTION -->
<section id="sec4">
<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">SECTION 4</h4>
<h1 style="margin-top:0;">HIDING</h1>
<p>As the hider, it is your job to stay hidden for as long as possible. Stay
hidden longer than anyone else, and the game is yours. At the start
of each round, you’ll be given a certain amount of time to choose—
and travel to—a hiding zone somewhere on your map. While the
seekers are en route, you’ll have to juggle answering questions,
mapping out a perfect final hiding spot, and assembling the perfect
hand using cards from the hider deck.</p>

<h2>HIDING ZONES</h2>
<p>Your hiding zone is a circle located somewhere within the game
map—once the seekers start seeking, this zone is your new home. You
only have a certain amount of time—the hiding period—to get from
wherever the round starts to your hiding zone. Much like any other
part of the game, you’ll only be able to use your pre-established
transit system to get to your hiding zone during this time, so make
sure you plan on going somewhere you know you can get to. If the
hiding period ends and you’re somewhere else, then that’s where
your hiding zone is.</p>

<p>Choosing the right hiding zone is the single most impactful decision
you’ll make during your run. Out-of-the-way locations on the edges of
the transit network can be harder to identify and travel to during the
main game, but that sparseness is a double-edged sword: once the
seekers have narrowed down the map to a small set of possible
stations, your location can make it much easier to identify your
exact hiding zone. Likewise, the densest parts of your map may lend
the protection of complexity but offer the seekers easier question
opportunities and leave you exposed to a potentially devastating
(tentacle question).</p>

<p>Every hiding zone must be centered on a transit station. There
may be other transit stations within your zone, but you’ll have to
choose a particular transit station to be “yours.” Many of the seekers’
questions will reference this station or force you to take pictures
around it, so it’s important that you know exactly which station
this is. The rest of your zone extends a certain distance outward
from this station—in small and medium games, this zone is drawn as
a 1/4-mile radius from the icon for that station on your map; in large
games it is a 1/2-mile radius. You must stay in this circle for your
entire round.</p>

<p>When in your hiding zone, you’re free to do whatever you like—go
shopping, have a meal, see the sights—but don’t get too distracted.
Many photo questions will involve going somewhere else in your
zone to take a photo of something in a fairly short window of time. If
you’d like, you can take these photos ahead of time to give you more
freedom once you choose your final hiding spot, or you might want
to remain flexible. We recommend spending some time scouting
your zone for a perfect final hiding spot.</p>

<h2>HIDING SPOTS</h2>
<p>
    Once the seekers have entered your hiding zone and the end game has begun
    you must stay put in a single spot until they've found you—this is your
    final hiding spot.
</p>
<p>
    Hiding spots can be anywhere within your hiding zone, but they must be
    somewhere that is publicly accessible during all game hours (all hours
    you will be playing excluding rest periods.) You cannot, for example
    hide in a bathroom stall or someone's house. This does not mean that
    your hiding spot has to be on literal public property, but rather
    that the seekers must be able to access it at any point during the
    game. You should also make sure that staying in your spot for an
    extended period of time will not raise any suspicions or create
    the potential for you to get kicked out—for this reason we'd
    suggest avoiding stores or other businesses, even if they are
    open during all game hours.
</p>
<p>
    Your hiding spot must also be within 10 feet of a marked path
    or road on the app(s) that you are using for your game—no wandering
    off into the wilderness or swimming out to sea. Viable paths and roads
    should be easy to discern on any map app, but if there's any question
    as to whether one counts, the test is whether or not your map app will
    use them for walking directions. In other words, the seekers should be
    able to theoretically follow a route generated by the app to be within
    10 feet of your hiding spot.
</p>
<p>
    Your hiding spot is considered final the moment that the end game starts.
    If you aren't where you want to be when the seekers enter your hiding zone, 
    too bad—wherever you're standing at that moment is your hiding spot. (If, 
    for whatever reason, you aren't somewhere publicly accessible when the end 
    game starts, you must immediately go to the nearest possible publicly 
    accessible spot and stay there instead.)
</p>
<p>
    We recommend spending some time scoping out your zone and looking for the
    perfect hiding spot—a clever enough spot can buy you an hour or more even
    after the seekers have found your station.
</p>

<h2>THE HIDER DECK</h2>
<p>The hider deck is your one and only weapon to use against the
seekers, so you’ll have to use it wisely.</p>

<p>Every time the seekers ask a question, you get to draw and
keep a certain number of cards from the hider deck (e.g. measuring
questions let you draw 3 and keep 1). You can keep up to 6 cards
(unless boosted by certain powerups). If, at any point, your hand is
full and you draw another card, you must immediately discard or
play cards until you’re back down to 6.</p>

<p>Cards from the hider deck can provide you with all sorts of
    advantages—some in response to questions, some at the end of your
    round, and some whenever you think they make the most sense. In total,
    there are three different types of cards you can draw from hider deck.
    Time Bonuses, Powerups, and Curses.
</p>

<h3>TIME BONUSES</h3>
<p>Time bonus cards come in varying values and count toward the
hider’s final hiding time. These cards cannot be “played,” and the only
way they leave the hider’s hand is if they are discarded. Time bonuses
are added to the hider’s final hiding time only if they are in the
hider’s hand at the end of the round; discarding a time bonus means
it will no longer count toward your final time. You should aim to hold
as many time bonuses at the end of a round as possible. Time bonuses
automatically scale based on your game size, so three values are
listed on each card. Make sure you’re using the right one for your
game size!</p>

<h3>POWERUPS</h3>
<p>There are several different types of powerup cards you can draw
from the hider deck. These cards can be played at any time and allow
you to take a particular type of advantageous action a single time.
Once powerup cards have been used, they are discarded from your
hand. You only need to inform the seekers that you are playing a
powerup if that powerup has some kind of direct effect on them (i.e.,
something they need to know about). These are the powerups in the
hider deck:</p>

<h4>Veto</h4>
<p>The veto powerup can be played in response to any question instead
of answering. The seekers get no answer to their question and are
informed you have used a veto. The question is considered asked, so it
cannot be asked again at its base cost, but you receive no card reward
for it.</p>

<h4>Randomize</h4>
<p>The randomize powerup can be played in response to any question
instead of answering. After you have used a randomize powerup, the
seekers must choose (at random, e.g. using dice) a different unasked
question from the same category. That question is then automatically
asked instead, and you provide an answer as normal. The original
question is not considered asked, so it can still be asked again at its
normal cost. If the randomize pulls a question that returns a null
answer, so be it.</p>

<h4>Discard 1, Draw 2 / Discard 2, Draw 3</h4>
<p>These powerups can be played at any time and allow you to discard
1 (or 2) undesired cards in your hand in exchange for drawing
2 (or 3) new cards from the top of the deck. For example, if you play
“Discard 1, Draw 2,” you discard one single card from your hand, then
draw and keep two new cards. Because the “Discard 1, Draw 2” card
will also leave your hand after you play it, you end up with the same
number of total cards you started with, just potentially better ones.</p>

<p>If you do not have enough extra cards to discard, these powerups
cannot be played. For instance, you cannot play “Discard 2, Draw 3”
if you only have one card in your hand.</p>

<h4>Draw 1, Expand Maximum Hand Size by 1</h4>
<p>This powerup can be played at any time. First, you draw and keep 1
card from the top of the deck. Then, your max hand size increases
by 1 for the rest of the round (so from 6 to 7, or 7 to 8 if you use two
of these).</p>

<h4>Duplicate</h4>
<p>The duplicate powerup can be played as an exact copy of any other
card—curse, powerup, or time bonus—currently in your hand. Once
played, the original card will remain in your hand and can still
be played later. If a duplicate remains in your hand at the end of
the round, it can be used as a copy of any time bonus in your hand,
effectively doubling that bonus.</p>

<h4>Move</h4>
<p>The move powerup, if played at the right moment, can be one of the
most powerful cards in the game. When played, you are given a
certain amount of time based on your game size to establish a brand-
new hiding zone. The rules for finding a new hiding zone apply as
usual—center yourself on a new transit station, and you can only use
transit to reach your new location. While you move, your timer is
paused, and the seekers must stay where they are (they can’t move or
ask new questions) until the move timer is up. Then, once the move
timer is done, the game resumes and your hiding timer continues
from exactly where it left off. It is crucial to do this at the perfect
moment, because playing the move has a severe cost: you must
immediately discard your entire hand and inform the seekers of your
original transit station after playing it. Also, the move cannot be
played during the end game. So you must be confident that the
seekers are close to finding you, and that you’re better off starting
from scratch rather than playing the cards you have in hand.</p>

<h3>CURSES</h3>
<p>Curse cards are played against the seekers as a means to slow them
down, prevent them from asking questions, or just to annoy them.
Every curse is unique, with some kind of one-time effect that lasts
a certain duration. Once a curse is used, it is discarded and removed
from your hand. Many curses have a “casting cost” that must be met
before it can be played in some circumstances. Some curses reference
certain conditions, like “seekers must be at least 10 miles away,” or
they may require you to discard additional cards from your hand.
If you do not meet the cost, you cannot play that curse. Some curses
specifically mention preventing the seekers from taking transit or
asking questions—only one such curse can be active at a time. Wait
until the first is cleared before playing another that does the same
thing. The seekers must inform you when they clear a curse so you
know you can cast another.</p>

<p>In case of rules disputes, here are notes for each curse in the hider
deck:</p>

<h4>Curse of the Luxury Car</h4>
<p>You must be able to identify the car in question when sending the
photo, and the seekers must agree that it is, in fact, the car you claim
it is. Use the car’s MSRP, factoring in its year of production, and
disregard any add-ons or modifications (for example, upgrades to
the car’s interior, special tires, custom colors, etc.). The photo you send
must include enough of the car for it to be clearly identifiable. If you
or the seekers are unsure of the car’s exact production year or exact
model, both sides must come to a consensus on which model and
year to use.</p>

<h4>Curse of the Bridge Troll</h4>
<p>“Bridge” is defined as any elevated structure acting as a crossing for
a road or railway, intended to be used by pedestrians, cars, or other
vehicles. All seekers must have some part of their body underneath
some portion of the bridge when the next question is asked. If there
are no bridges on the game map, this curse should be removed from
the deck.</p>

<h4>Curse of the Drained Brain</h4>
<p>This curse may be used (and its cost paid) during the interval between
a question and its answer, allowing a player to discard their hand
before receiving the reward from that question. You may not, however,
ban the question that has just been asked, even if you have not yet
answered it. Any questions removed from the game using this curse
cannot be asked again, even at an increased cost.</p>

<h4>Curse of the Water Weight</h4>
<p>Any liquid already traveling with the seekers at the time this curse is
played (e.g. water bottles) does not count toward fulfilling it. The liquid
can be in any number of containers and can be passed around between
seekers at any time. It can be set down when the seekers are stationary
or on transit, but it is considered “abandoned” once it is more than 10
feet away from every seeker. The hider must be informed of all liquid
movement. “Body of water” in this context does not necessarily have
to be natural, but it cannot be a swimming pool, and it must be large
enough to appear on the map.</p>

<p>“Bug,” in this context, refers to any insect, arachnid, diplopod, or
anything else commonly and colloquially called a “bug.” “Wild” means
undomesticated or not kept in human captivity (including large outdoor
enclosures like farms or sanctuaries). The photo must include enough
of the creature for it to be recognizable. If there is any dispute about
an animal’s classification, use Wikipedia. Creatures outside these
categories (like crustaceans) cannot be used for this curse.</p>

<h4>Curse of the Egg Partner</h4>
<p>The egg may be from any type of animal, but it must be a real egg (a
chocolate or plastic egg does not count). Any visible fracture, however
small, counts as failing the egg. If you do not want to purchase items
during the game, or you object to this curse on ethical grounds, remove
it from the deck. For any curse that requires “all seekers” to do
something, the egg is considered one of the seekers. For instance,
using the Curse of the Lemon Phylactery afterward would require
attaching a lemon to the egg as well.</p>

<h4>Curse of the Jammed Door</h4>
<p>Seekers must roll two six-sided dice to pass through a doorway once
they can see it in person. For example, if they want to enter a train,
they cannot roll until the train arrives and its doors are visible. Doorways
within a single building that lead to other rooms inside that same
building do not require a roll. If there is any reasonable doubt as to
whether it counts as a “separate building,” err on the side of requiring
a dice check. If the curse expires while a doorway is on cooldown, that
cooldown ends immediately.</p>

<h4>Curse of the Spotty Memory</h4>
<p>The seekers should assign each category of question (matching,
measuring, radar, etc.) to a number on a die before they first roll. In
a small-sized game, there are only five categories, so a roll of six
would be re-rolled.</p>

<h4>Curse of the Bird Guide</h4>
<p>The bird must be in frame from the start of the video. “In frame”
means any recognizable part of the bird is on camera. The seekers
may attempt this any number of times.</p>

<h4>Curse of the Unguided Tourist</h4>
<p>The “human-built structure” cannot be any part of a road, including
curbs or sidewalks. If you are playing in an area with very limited Google
Street View (e.g. Germany), remove this curse from the deck.</p>

<h4>Curse of the Ransom Note</h4>
<p>If fulfilling this curse’s casting cost would otherwise stop you from
playing a curse, once you have met the cost, this curse must be used
immediately. The letters cannot be printed digitally; they must come
from magazines, newspapers, or other physical materials the seekers
might encounter in the “real world.” You do not have to form complete
sentences, but the hider should still understand your question without
further clarification. You may use easy-to-grasp abbreviations (like
using “2” in place of “to”). If the question needs extra context beyond
the basic sentence, you may provide that normally (for instance, a
location pin for a thermometer question) — it doesn’t have to be part of
the ransom note itself.</p>

<h4>Curse of the Mediocre Travel Agent</h4>
<p>“Publicly accessible,” here, follows the same rules as publicly
accessible hiding spots. The destination can be a single point
or a general area, such as a park or a store. A “souvenir” can be
any physical object. It does not need to be carried by the seekers at
all times, but it must be in their possession at the moment the hider
is caught.</p>

<h4>Curse of the Impressionable Consumer</h4>
<p>Any object or display that primarily serves to advertise a product,
service, or business counts as an advertisement. If it advertises
a specific service (e.g. “massage”), the seekers must pay for and
obtain that service. If it advertises a location (e.g. an amusement
park) rather than a specific service, the seekers must go inside that
location. Publicly owned places (like a city park) do not count. If you
do not want to risk spending money, remove this curse.</p>

<h4>Curse of the U-Turn</h4>
<p>“Next station” refers to the next stop on the specific route the seekers
are currently riding; if their route is skipping certain stops, those are
ignored. If you are unsure which route they’re on, you may ask for
clarification. In case of ambiguity, you should tell them which station
you believe is next. Even if the line eventually curves back in your
favor, as long as the immediate next station is farther away, you
can cast this curse.</p>

<h4>Curse of the Cairn</h4>
<p>If fulfilling the casting cost of this curse would otherwise prevent you
from playing a curse, once the cost is met, you must cast this curse
immediately. “Found in nature” means the rocks were collected
by hand rather than purchased, but not necessarily from an
untouched wilderness.</p>

<h4>Curse of the Distant Cuisine</h4>
<p>The restaurants you select must explicitly reference a single country
(or a single region within one country) in either their name or their
public-facing materials (like a menu). If a restaurant is identified
with multiple countries or with a large transnational region (like
“Asian cuisine”), it is invalid. Distance from that country is measured
from your current position to the nearest point in that country.</p>

<h4>Curse of the Lemon Phylactery</h4>
<p>The lemon must be a real lemon. It can be attached by any means
but must remain in contact with a seeker’s skin or clothing at all
times. Once the lemon drops off, the hider should be notified right
away so they can apply the relevant time bonus. “Cemetery” here
refers to any land officially designated as a burial ground.</p>

<h4>Curse of the Gambler’s Feet</h4>
<p>This curse uses a single six-sided die. If there are multiple seekers,
they may roll individually or choose one die roll for everyone, but if
somebody accidentally takes extra steps, they must retroactively
step back. Seekers may not exploit uncounted steps on purpose.
If it would be unsafe not to continue moving (e.g. in the middle of a
busy street), they must handle that with caution.</p>

<h4>Curse of the Hidden Hangman</h4>
<p>The chosen five-letter word must exist in a dictionary of the language
you’re playing in. You cannot use a French word if nobody speaks
French, for instance. If the hider ever fails to respond to a question
within 30 seconds, this curse is cleared immediately.</p>

<h4>Curse of the Endless Tumble</h4>
<p>100 feet is measured horizontally, parallel to the ground. The die
may be rolled on an incline. If it rolls off a surface or doesn’t land
cleanly, it doesn’t count. Any bonuses the hider gets are applied
right away.</p>

<h4>Curse of the Right Turn</h4>
<p>This curse only applies to actual street intersections (for cars), or
the sidewalks beside them. It has no effect indoors or in areas with
no streets at all.</p>

<h4>Curse of the Urban Explorer</h4>
<p>Any questions that were asked before this curse was played while
the seekers were riding transit must still be answered, but moving
forward, the seekers cannot stand on a transit platform or be inside
any transit building while asking new questions. They can still ride
the transit; they just have to disembark elsewhere before asking.</p>

<h4>Curse of the Overflowing Chalice</h4>
<p>Matching questions become “draw 4, keep 1.” Measuring questions
become “draw 4, keep 1.” Thermometer questions become “draw 3,
keep 1.” Radar questions become “draw 3, keep 1.” Photo questions
become “draw 2, keep 1,” and Tentacle questions become “draw 5,
keep 2.”</p>

<h4>Curse of the Labyrinth</h4>
<p>“Solvable” means there’s a conventional maze solution: you must be
able to draw a single continuous line from the maze’s start to its
finish. Your timer begins the moment you draw the first line; time
spent prepping materials doesn’t count. You can scrap the maze and
begin a new one, but you cannot restart the timer. You must not use
the internet or any other references; the maze has to come from
your own mind.</p>

<h4>CUSTOMIZING YOUR DECK</h4>
<p>We’ve provided you with a default hider deck that should
likely work out of the box without any adjustments. We do, however,
encourage you to tinker with the deck and we have provided some
blank cards to help you customize it if you wish.</p>

<p>The default hider deck includes a set of curse cards that we believe
are well-balanced and should be doable in most conditions, but it is
entirely possible that there are curses that are not possible—or at
least not feasible—given the scope or area of your game. There are
also curses that may require spending small amounts of money—or
are otherwise undesirable for the vibe you are trying to cultivate—
that you may want to take out of the deck. If you decide to remove
any curses, we encourage you to use the blank cards to write custom
curses of your own. Generally, we recommend that your deck be about
50% time bonus cards, 25% powerup cards, and 25% curses, but these
ratios can be adjusted up or down depending on how much agency
you want to give the hider.</p>

<!-- GENERAL TIPS -->
<section id="sec5">
<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">SECTION 5</h4>
<h1 style="margin-top:0;">GENERAL TIPS</h1>
<p>Make no mistake, Hide and Seek can be a physically and mentally
draining game. Particularly for medium and large games, which
might last multiple days, adequate preparation is hugely important
and should not be disregarded when organizing your game. Here are
some tips for staying healthy and comfortable while playing Hide and
Seek:</p>

  <p>Always pack enough food and water for at least one full day of
  gameplay. As the hider, you may find yourself in situations
  where you cannot access food or water for hours at a time,
  and the same can be true for seekers if they get stranded or are
  traveling between stations. Use rest periods to restock.</p>
  <p>Consider weather in all parts of the game map, across every day
  you’ll be playing. Look out in particular for mountainous regions
  where weather may change precipitously, or areas prone to flash
  rainstorms. You do not want to be playing Hide and Seek soaked
  or freezing.</p>
  <p>In any configuration of the game, we highly recommend that all
  players carry a portable battery to charge their phones. You will
  be using your phone fairly often for research and communication,
  and there is a chance it will not last a full day of gameplay.</p>
  <p>When choosing a hiding zone, ensure that there is a bathroom you
  can access somewhere in the zone. Smaller train stations and bus
  stops may not have restrooms. Seek out restaurants or other
  publicly accessible restrooms.</p>
  <p>On a similar note, check your hiding zone for hotels ahead of time if
  your game spans multiple days and is far from home. You can leave
  your zone during rest periods, but that might be logistically tough.
  Plan ahead.</p>
  <p>You always have the option to pause the game if it becomes
  necessary. Do your best to avoid abusing this or using it for a
  strategic advantage, but your safety and comfort come first. When
  the game is paused, the hider’s timer and all other in-game timers
  stop. When the game is resumed, all players must remain in the
  same positions as when the game was paused.</p>
  <p>As mentioned earlier, ensure that your map only includes areas
  where all players will feel safe traveling. This should be discussed
  in advance, and any unsafe areas excluded.</p>
  <p>For additional safety, share your location with someone outside
  the game, in case of a health or weather emergency or other
  unexpected event.</p>

<!-- EXPERIMENTAL GAME DESIGNS -->
 <section id="sec6">
<h4 style="margin-bottom:0;">SECTION 6</h4>
<h1 style="margin-top:0;">EXPERIMENTAL GAME DESIGNS</h1>
<p>In the previous sections, we’ve detailed the rules for the basic
configurations of Hide and Seek. We have, however, considered
some alternate versions of the game, and we thought we’d detail
those here in case you’d like to try them—or use them as a jumping
off point for your own game model.</p>

<h4>PLAYING WITH CARS (OR ON FOOT)</h4>
<p>It is not lost on us that your hometown may not have sufficient public
transit to play even the smallest version of Hide and Seek. Of course,
there’s always the possibility of playing when you’re out of town, but
you may still be determined to make it work with cars and feet. In this
case, you’ll have to make a few modifications to the game’s traditional
ruleset:</p>

  <p><strong>Setting Your Map:</strong> Without a transit system, setting your map will
  become a matter of simply defining map borders. Make sure these
  are drawn carefully, as it will be easier to confuse what is or isn’t a
  valid hiding spot without a transit system.</p>
  <p><strong>Hiding Zones:</strong> Hiding zones will still be drawn as a circle of varying
  size, depending on game size, somewhere on the map. Instead of
  being anchored on a transit station, you should choose a street
  terminus to act as the center of your zone—that means the point
  at which one street ends or at an intersection. This street terminus
  should serve the same role as your transit station. Photos that
  would normally be taken at a transit station would be taken there,
  and any question referencing station names references that street’s
  name, etc.</p>
  <p><strong>Questions:</strong> Most questions will still work as intended. Ignore any
  questions that reference transit frequency or details. Some
  questions that refer to the hider’s station will now refer to their
  street terminus. Adjust accordingly.</p>
  <p><strong>Curses:</strong> Any curses that cannot be played while seekers are on
  transit should not be played when they are in a moving car.
  Likewise, curses that prevent the seekers from taking “transit”
  will apply to cars as well.</p>

<h4>PLAYING WITH TWO TEAMS OF SEEKERS</h4>
<p>We’ve always liked the idea of playing with two teams of seekers
competing against each other to find the same hider. Ultimately, we
never used this version for our show given the number of narrative
threads and players it would require. You, however, are probably not
making a show, and so you might actually be able to make this work.</p>

<p>In this version of the game, scores would not be determined by
hiding time. Instead, players would be competing for the best
seeking time. This can be done in one of two ways: by points or by
overall lowest seeking time.</p>

  <p><strong>If the winner is determined by points,</strong> each round is worth 1 point.
  Whichever seeking team finds the hider first (lowest seeking time)
  gets the point. In this configuration, the hider is neutral while
  hiding, since a point will be awarded to either of the other teams
  no matter what. Because they have no incentive to slow the teams
  down, the hider might not need or want to use the deck. Instead,
  maybe the hider manages splitting the deck between the two
  seeking teams each time a question is asked. This would be a big
  structural change to the standard rules.</p>
  <p><strong>If the winner is determined by the overall lowest seeking time,</strong> then
  it’s just whichever team has the fastest time to find the hider in
  any round. The hider does have an incentive to make hiding tough,
  since they want to outdo the other teams’ times. This means the
  hider could keep the deck as usual and cast curses on whichever
  seeking team they want at a given moment, etc.</p>

<p>In either case, many of the standard game mechanics remain
unchanged. Map setup follows the same rules, as do hiding zones
and timekeeping. If you plan on playing some version with two
teams, we recommend writing a few custom curses (or powerups)
designed specifically for seeking teams, as you’ll find certain curses
about distance or hider movement might not apply the same way.</p>

<h4>GLOBAL HIDE AND SEEK</h4>
<p>Should you do this? No. Will it work? Probably not. Is someone going
to try anyway? Almost certainly. So here are a few thoughts on how
Hide and Seek could work across the entire globe:</p>


  <p>You almost certainly won’t be able to dictate a specific list
  of transit networks, so you’ll need to define valid “stations”
  worldwide. Maybe define them as any commercial airport with
  a certain passenger threshold, plus major rail stations, etc.</p>
  <p>You’d need a new global time scale. Maybe hiding periods last
  24 hours. You might scale time bonuses, time penalties, and
  question costs up accordingly.</p>
  <p>The curses would need to be massively revised. A curse requiring
  you to travel to a certain place might be insane if that place is
  thousands of miles away. Then again, maybe that’s part of the
  fun, if you have unlimited resources for travel.</p>

<p>Anyway, there’s almost no way this will be balanced. We don’t
recommend it, but if you do it, we want to hear about it out of
morbid curiosity.</p>
